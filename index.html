        <p class = "about">
            I am learning web development, passionate about tech. I know C and fundamentals of HTML,CSS. Outside of coding, I am a music producer and exploring sound design and video editing.
            I really like to implement whatever i have learned into real life to learn from the results myself. Even though my knowledge of tech might still be growing at this time, i am open to 
            new challenges, exploring other fields, build new stuff and have fun while learning.
